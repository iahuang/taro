# TaroJS - Test Project

This folder will change frequently as Taro JS is developed.
Do not use this project as a basis for your own projects. This project is meant only
to test and debug development features.

This project depends directly on the Typescript source directory to work, and will therefore always use the current build of Taro.

## Usage

```bash
> tsc --watch
```
To start a development environment. Note that the project will be rebuilt if changes are made to `taro/src`
